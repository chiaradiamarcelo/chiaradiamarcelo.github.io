Hey! I'm **Marcelo Chiaradia**, a Software Engineer with nearly 20 years of experience.

I advocate for and am a proponent of software craftsmanship and technical practices such as Pair Programming, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, TDD, Refactoring, and Simple Design.

Convinced of where the real cost of software development lies, I focus on quality practices that enable us to deliver sustainably and continuously over time.

I'm always happy to connect with motivated colleagues. If you'd like to chat, feel free to drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-chiaradia/)!
